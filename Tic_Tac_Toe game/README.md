🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🕹️


📝 How It Works
🎲 Two players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
🏆 The first player to get three in a row – across, down, or diagonally – wins!
💡 If all squares are filled without a winner, it's a tie!

Board Layout:

 1 | 2 | 3

 7 | 8 | 9

🎯 Choose your spot by entering a number from 1 to 9.
🔄 Alternate turns until someone wins or it’s a draw.

🛠️ Game Mechanics



❌ Invalid Moves: The game will prompt you to try again if the spot is already taken or if your input is out of range 🚫.
🏆 Victory Check: Rows, columns, and diagonals are scanned after each move to see if you’ve clinched a win! 🥇
